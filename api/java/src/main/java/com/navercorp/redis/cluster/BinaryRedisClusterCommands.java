     * Serialize the value stored at key in a Redis-specific format and return it to the user. The returned value can be synthesized back into a Redis key using the RESTORE command.
     * The serialization format is opaque and non-standard, however it has a few semantical characteristics:
     * It contains a 64-bit checksum that is used to make sure errors will be detected. The RESTORE command makes sure to check the checksum before synthesizing a key using the serialized value.
     * Values are encoded in the same format used by RDB.
     * An RDB version is encoded inside the serialized value, so that different Redis versions with incompatible RDB formats will refuse to process the serialized value.
     * The serialized value does NOT contain expire information. In order to capture the time to live of the current value the PTTL command should be used.
     * If key does not exist a nil bulk reply is returned.
     * <p>
     * Time complexity: O(1) to access the key and additional O(N*M) to serialized it, where N is the number of Redis objects composing the value and M their average size. For small string values the time complexity is thus O(1)+O(1*M) where M is small, so simply O(1).
